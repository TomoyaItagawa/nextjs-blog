**Deploy to Vercel**

You can use default values for the following settings â€” no need to change anything. Vercel automatically detects that you have a Next.js app and chooses optimal build settings for you.

- Project Name
- Root Directory
- Build Command
- Output Directory
- Development Command

When you deploy, your Next.js app will start building. It should finish in under a minute.
